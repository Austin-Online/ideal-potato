Whiskful Thinking

## Description
This is an app where you can boldly post your most adventurous recipes and share your kitchen journey with fellow foodies who crave that electrifying rush of a tasteful gamble.
You will be able to view other user's recipes and also comment your thought's about them. 

As a user I want to be able to share my recipes and see other’s flavor profile. I want to be able to express my experience with the recipe and save recipes I’d like to try.

We do have bugs that need to be fixed, such as when a user is logged out, the token is still trying to decode and throwing an invalid token error. If we were to continue to work on this project we would want to change the whole design and make it more appealing. We would love to add images and be able to share or print and save recipes. 
We are proud to reach mvp status, but realize there is many room to grow.
